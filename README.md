# stalking_activity_on_messeneger
Simple script that monitors somebody's activity on messenger. Perfect for every stalker!

Script is based on Selenium webdriver in Chrome, however now I believe that Facebook API would be better solution. 
Idea is simple, the script checks activity of given person using loop, with given frequency and time and saves the data to a file.

Ideas of improvements:
- the script could note only if there is the change of activity
- monitor if the message was read and send some kind of notifications
- show graphically the activity on timeline 

Obviously this small project was made just for fun and self-development, not for suspicious or harmful purposes.

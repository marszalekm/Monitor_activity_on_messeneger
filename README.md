# Stalking activity on messeneger (May 2020)
Simple script that monitors somebody's activity on messenger. Perfect for every stalker!

Script is based on Selenium webdriver in Chrome, however I believe that Facebook API would be better solution for this task. 
Idea is simple, the script imports proper information from options.py file and checks activity of given person using loop, with given frequency and time and saves the data to a file.

Ideas of improvements:
- the script could note only if user's activity changes
- monitor if the message was read and send some kind of notifications
- show graphically the activity on timeline 

Obviously this small project was made just for fun and self-development, not for suspicious or harmful purposes.
